# Exiobase_for_brightwat2.5
This code is for using exiobase in brightway 2.5. Datapackage file is for creating a datapackage of exiobase and database is for creating a database
Datapackage is much (much much) faster, but it is not possible to open directly in activity browser (version 2.5). After runing database file (it takes time), is possible to open in activity browser (for version 2.5)
